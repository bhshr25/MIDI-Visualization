# MIDI Visualization with Audio Playback

This Python project visualizes MIDI files as circular spike-based representations. Each note in the MIDI file corresponds to a spike along a circle's circumference, with the spike lengths proportional to the frequencies of the notes. The project also includes audio playback of the MIDI file, synchronized with the visual spikes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Pygame
- Mido

## Features
- MIDI-to-audio playback using Pygame.
- Circular visualization of MIDI notes.
- Frequency-based spike lengths with color mapping.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install mido pygame matplotlib
